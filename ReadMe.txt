School Life Sims was a game I created along with 3 of my team mates as our submission to the annual hackathon: Calgary Hacks 2022. Our task was to create a game within 24 hours that reflected the typical student's life in a fun way. We created the game using C#, Unity game engine, as well as pixel art.
